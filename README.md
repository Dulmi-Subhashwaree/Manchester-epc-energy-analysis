# Manchester-epc-energy-analysis
📊 Energy Performance Analysis of Manchester (2014–2024)

This project analyzes Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) data for residential properties in Greater Manchester from 2014 to 2024 using SQL Server and Microsoft Power BI. The goal is to evaluate current vs. potential energy efficiency, CO₂ emissions, energy costs, and recommended retrofit measures to support sustainability-focused decision making.

The analysis integrates EPC Certificates and Recommendations datasets using a relational key (LMK_KEY), enabling both performance assessment and improvement potential analysis through interactive dashboards.
